/**
 * This is a demo program of HanNanum that helps users to utilize the HanNanum library easily.
 * It uses a predefined work flow for morphological analysis and POS tagging with 9 morpheme tags,
 * which can be used by users who want simpler POS tagging results. <br>
 * <br>
 * It performs POS tagging for a Korean document with the following procedure:<br>
 * 		1. Create two predefined work flows for comparison between POS tagging with 69 tags and with 9 tags.<br>
 * 		2. Activate the work flows in multi-thread mode.<br>
 * 		3. Analyze a document using each work flow.<br>
 * 		4. Print the result on the console.<br>
 * 		5. Close the work flow.<br>
