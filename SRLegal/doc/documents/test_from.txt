Hrry Potter nd the Sorcerer's Stone


CHPTER ONE

THE WHO LIVED

Mr. nd Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to sy
tht they were perfectly norml, thnk you very much. They were the lst
people you'd expect to be involved in nything strnge or mysterious,
becuse they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley ws the director of  firm clled Grunnings, which mde
drills. He ws  big, beefy mn with hrdly ny neck, lthough he did
hve  v Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. Du
rsley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
sister and her good-for-nddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived
 in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a so, but they had never even seen him. This boy
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
Dudley mixing with a child like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things soon be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the cheek, andng a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got
into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
